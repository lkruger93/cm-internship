# CM Internship Application
Repository for application to CM developer internship

## Work/Project examples
1. Project for my final presentation in my Web Developer course at SAIT.  It uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP and includes photos taken and edited by me. https://fluffy-friends.herokuapp.com/index.php
2. Website completed during my 8 week practicum to complete my SAIT certificate.  Used Shopify and I mainly worked on changing the colours and layout of the website, as well as adding photos.  Some text and images change periodically but the biggest changes, such as drop down menus, colour themes and layout of the different categories were all created by me.  I also added tags to the site, which had not been there previously and made a big difference in the UI and UX of the site, as it made it much easier to narrow down searches for specific products.  https://castletoys.ca/
3. Personal project to brush up my skills, features images found on Google but edited to fit in GIMP.  Touches on some things I'm passionate about and the use of CSS and PNG images I think makes it look interesting and professional. *add site when finished*

## Inspiration
1. Attention to detail in The Last of Us Part II.  So many games now feature amazing graphics, lighting, animation and more, but this game has been brought to the forefront of this due to its use of new technology to make these things happen, as well as adding some new features that have rarely been seen before, namely accessibility settings, allowing players who may have disabilities affecting hearing, sight, and more who may otherwise be unable to play conventional video games to enjoy the game in their own way.  For myself I was most inspired by the graphics and the lighting, as seeing it being so much better than games made even a few years earlier was really cool. Although not completely possible to showcase these things in a game without actually playing it, the gameplay demo video shows a lot of how it looks and makes you appreciate the effort it must have taken. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btmN-bWwv0A
2. Allowing customization and colour changes using CSS, JavaScript and HTML in CodePen.  I was drawn to this codepen mainly because I love horses and am always interested in ways people can make cool horse-related things using nothing but pure coding.  I was also interested in this because in one of my previous projects (Fluffy Friend Finder) I wanted to do something similar with changing how an SVG looked using code, however I used JavaScript and just a few CSS classes to change the colours rather than CSS variables, which I would love to learn more about how to use myself. https://codepen.io/jakob-e/pen/ggGGRB

## Focus
Given the opportunity, I would love use my time learning and building something relating to game development to enhance the building experience of technologies, namely gamifying a larger task relating to building a project or site to make it make more sense along the way and hopefully make the experience more straightforward and pleasant.  Also being given the opportunity to use my creative skills in this same way would be an exciting opportunity for me as I could see it leading me in many different directions and help me become a better developer overall, as creating projects that look neat and simple is something that is important in many types of development, especially when gamified.
